				'In Kundalini Yoga, we practice specific sets or Kriyas that will target specific physical parts of the body/organs as well as specific energetic parts like chakras and other energy points.',
				'The structure is also set, by tuning in with a mantra call, some warm-up exercises, practicing the actual Kriya followed by a meditation and relaxation and tuning out with a short mantra.',
				'Our classes are open to all level practitioners and all abilities. If there is a specific issue, area you would like some help or clarification please let me know in advance and we can plan together how we can work around those issues.

			title: 'Yoga & Anxiety',
			description: [
				'When faced with challenges and issues that seem unresolvable, the body releases energy that appears as a feeling of unsettled, chronic nervousness and of anxiety. Mindfulness is a great tool to release this feeling and tune the body and mind to a happier state. It’s been shown time and time again that regular practice of yoga can help in dealing with anxiety and stress.',
				'In a recent study in New York University by Naomi M Simon MD following 226 men and women, separating them in three groups, had one receiving CBT, the second practicing Kundalini yoga and the third receiving stress management education. The first two groups showed to be more efficient in dealing with stressful situations.',
				'In the Kundalini yoga group 54% showed an improvement on symptoms. The combination of the physical exercise, vibrational sound of mantras and breathwork (pranayama) allowed the participants to deal with the anxiety and reduce its level and effect in the short term.',
				'In short, regular practice can help a person become more grounded, self assured, confident and find stillness and quiet in a troubled mind. Also to be physically fitter.'

			title: 'Savasana (what is it and why we practice it)',
			description: [
				'Just as at the end of every waking day, after all the activity (working day, a sports workout etc.), you get to bed to rest and let the body do its ‘housekeeping’ (recover, heal, regenerate) equally at the end of a yoga class you are led to practice savasana, the final relaxation.',
				'Savasana is the part of the practice where you will lay on the mat (sometimes may be sitting in easy pose or cross legged) and let the body totally relax letting all the muscle groups release and the mind let go. The importance of savasana is often underrated and some people just to save 10 or 15 minutes of their day may skip this part of the yoga class and just leave. This may be unsettling for the teacher who leads the class, most importantly may be unsettling for the rest of the yogi and yoginis that when it is their time to relax someone just gets up, packs their mat, bags, gets a coat on and opens and closes the door leaving the room. The purpose of the savasana, just like the much needed sleep at the end of a day, is to allow the body to relax on a mechanical level, ie let the muscles release and elongate naturally and let the joints to absorb the result of the movement of the past hour or so, as well as on an emotional level when the mind has time to absorb the essence of the mental exercise and awareness of the practice. This is the time that body and mind consolidates both the physical and the mental changes that happened in the practice. Now is that moment of the sweet feeling of achievement. Savasana is the moment that those stretched joints and open heart work together bringing release, healing, feeling of having done something good for yourself. This may be expressed with long sighs, a smile or even tears (of joy or sadness) as the wonderful miracle of your body lets everything do, releases energy and feelings.',
				'In one short word, Savasana is the moment your body receives from the practice and releases into the universe. It IS part of your yoga practice.'
